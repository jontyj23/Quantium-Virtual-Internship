# Quantium Virtual Internship

This repository contains the work that I have done for the Quantium Virtual Internship hosted on <a href="theforage.com">Forage</a>. It has been seperated into 3 tasks, each in their own folder for simplicity sake. 

To provide a brief summary, before the detailed explanation, the tasks are divided between the processes of:
- Task1 - an EDA of the purchasing behaviour and transaction data of customers of the company to determine which segments for the period were the main contributors to sales and assess the purchasing habits.
- Task 2 - an analysis of the effects of changes to 3 trial stores KPI over the period that trial changes were tested in the stores and the comparison of the measure of the change against the identified control stores.
- Task 3 - present the findings of task 1 and 2 to the client and offer actionable insights.

## Coding resources used

Python version 3.11.2

Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

## Task 1 - Data preparation and customer analysis

### Background information
We need to present a strategic recommendation to Julia that is supported by data which she can then use for the upcoming category review. However, to do so, we need to analyse the data to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours. The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour.

### Primary goals of the task
1. Examine transaction data - checking for missing values or outliers and clean the data
1. Examine customer data - similar to the above process
1. Data analysis on customer segments - visualizations of the customer and transaction data , assessing trends in the segments and finding the main contributors to sales
1. Deep dive into customer segment - assess most common brands and sizes of purchases by the customer segments identified in the previous goal

## Task 2

### Background information 
For this part of the project we will be examining the performance in trial vs control stores to provide a recommendation for each location based on our insight.

### Primary goals of the task
1. Identify the most suitable control stores
1. Compare trial and control stores over trial period and offer insight

## Task 3

### Background information

Provide commercial, actionable insights with the analysis from the previous sections and display it in a clear and concise way, with minimal jargon.
